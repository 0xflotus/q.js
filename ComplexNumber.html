			<p>
				Our regular, ordinary, everyday numbers are called
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number" target="_blank">real numbers</a>.
				These include integers and decimals.
				You can visualize real numbers as existing along an infinite number line—with zero in the middle, positive numbers counting up forever to infinity on the right, and negative numbers doing the exact opposite on the left.
			</p>
<pre><code>
…  -3  -2  -1   0  +1  +2  +3   …  
┄───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴─┬─┴──┬┴┬──┄  
                     √2    𝒆 π

			<p>
				When a real number is multiplied by itself the product is always positive.
				For example, if we choose the number 7 we see that 7 × 7 = 49.
				Similarly, had we chosen the negative number -7, the product would still be positive
				because two negative numbers multiplied together also produce a positive result;
				-7 × -7 = 49.
				For brevity we could rewrite these equations as 7<sup>2</sup> = 49 and -7<sup>2</sup> = 49, respectively.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root" target="_blank">square root</a> 
				of a real number has two possible answers. 
				The square root of 49, for example, is both 7 <em>and</em> -7
				because both are solutions for <span class="symbol">x</span> 
				in the equation <span class="symbol">x</span> = √49.
			</p>
			<h3 id="Imaginary_numbers">Imaginary numbers 𝕀</h3>
			<p>
				But suppose we wanted to find the square root of a <em>negative</em> number.
				Is there any number that could solve for <span class="symbol">x</span> 
				in the equation <span class="symbol">x</span> = √-49?
				Sadly, there is not. Or more precisely: there is not any <em>real</em> solution for the square root of a negative number.
			</p>

				In his 1991 address on “Creativity in Management”, Monty Python’s John Cleese
				articulates Edward de Bono’s concept of the
				<a href="https://youtu.be/Pb5oIIPO62g?t=1926" target="_blank">intermediate impossible (32:06)</a>
				as a useful stepping stone towards a novel and useful solution.
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number" target="_blank">Imaginary numbers</a> 
				might be considered an intermediate impossible. 
				The symbol <span class="symbol">i</span> is defined as the imaginary solution to the equation 
				<span class="symbol">x</span> = √-1,
				therefore <span class="symbol">i</span><sup>2</sup> = -1.
				With this imaginary device we now have a solution to the above equation 
				<span class="symbol">x</span> = √-49
				and that solution is 7<span class="symbol">i</span>.
				Let’s inspect that more closely.
			</p>
<pre><code>
𝒙 = √-49
𝒙 = √(49 × -1)
𝒙 = √49 × √-1
𝒙 = 7 × √-1
𝒙 = 7 × 𝒊
𝒙 = 7𝒊

</code></pre>


			<p>
				Our result of 7<span class="symbol">i</span> is an
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number" target="_blank">imaginary number</a>
				that consists of a real number multiplier, 7, and 
				our imaginary solution to √-1, called <span class="symbol">i</span>.
				Like real numbers, imaginary numbers also exist along an infinite number line.

				We just saw that multiplying a real number by <span class="symbol">i</span>
				yields an imaginary number.
				But what if you <em>add</em> a real number to an imaginary one?
				Things get <em>complex</em>.
				A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number" target="_blank">complex number</a>
				is a number that can be expressed in the form 
				<span class="symbol">r</span> + <span class="symbol">ri</span>,
				where <span class="symbol">r</span> is the real component and 
				<span class="symbol">ri</span> is the imaginary component. 
				Some examples might be 1 + 2<span class="symbol">i</span> or 3 - 4<span class="symbol">i</span>.
				This is what the <code>ComplexNumber</code> class was created to handle.
				Open up your JavaScript console and paste in the following:
			</p>
<pre><code>
var 
a = new Q.ComplexNumber( 1,  2 ),
b = new Q.ComplexNumber( 3, -4 )

a.toString()<span class="comment">//  Returns '1 + 2i'</span>
b.toString()<span class="comment">//  Returns '3 - 4i'</span>

</pre></code>
			<p>
				Now we have two variables, <span class="symbol">a</span> and <span class="symbol">b</span>, that we can operate with. 
				As you might guess, <code>ComplexNumber</code>
				includes instance methods for common operations like 
				addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divion.
				It also includes a handy <code>toString</code> for expressing
				a complex number in our familiar way.
				For example <code>a.toString()</code> will output <samp>1 + 2i</samp>.
				Try the following lines individually in your JavaScript console:
			</p>
<pre><code>
a.add( b ).toString()     <span class="comment">//  Returns  '4 - 2i'</span>
a.subtract( b ).toString()<span class="comment">//  Returns '-2 + 6i'</span>
a.multiply( b ).toString()<span class="comment">//  Returns '11 + 2i'</span>
a.divide( b ).toString()  <span class="comment">//  Returns '-0.2 + 0.4i'</span>

</pre></code>
			<p>
				We can now verify that <span class="symbol">i</span><sup>2</sup> = -1.
			</p>
<pre><code>
var i = new Q.ComplexNumber( 0, 1 )

i.toString()<span class="comment">//  Returns  'i'</span>
i.power( 2 ).toString()<span class="comment">//  Returns  '-1'</span>

</pre></code>
			<p>
				Operation functions on <code>Q.ComplexNumber</code> instances generally accept as 
				arguments both sibling instances and pure <code>Number</code> instances, though the 
				value returned is always an instance of <code>Q.ComplexNumber</code>.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>Constants</h3>
<pre><code>
ZERO     = new Q.ComplexNumber( 0, 0 )
ONE      = new Q.ComplexNumber( 1, 0 )
E        = new Q.ComplexNumber( Math.E,  0 )
PI       = new Q.ComplexNumber( Math.PI, 0 )
I        = new Q.ComplexNumber( 0, 1 )
EPSILON  = new Q.ComplexNumber( Q.EPSILON, Q.EPSILON )
INFINITY = new Q.ComplexNumber( Infinity, Infinity )
NAN      = new Q.ComplexNumber( NaN, NaN )
