				Q’s <code>ComplexNumber</code> class allows us to compute using the imaginary number 𝒊.
				Has it been a while since you last dealt with imaginary numbers? 
				Was that in high school?
				Or maybe never?
				Let’s back up a second.
			</p>
			<h3 id="Real_numbers">Real numbers: ℝ</h3>
			<p>
				Regular, ordinary numbers are called
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number" target="_blank">real numbers</a>.
				Integers, fractions, decimals… 
				You can visualize them all existing along an infinite number line—with zero in the middle, positive numbers counting up forever to infinity to the right, and negative numbers doing the exact opposite to the left:
			</p>
<pre><code>
…  -3  -2  -1   0  +1  +2  +3   …  
┄───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴─┬─┴──┬┴┬──┄  
                     √2    𝒆 π  

</pre></code>
			<h3 id="Imaginary_numbers">Imaginary numbers: 𝕀</h3>
			<p>
				Now let’s consider the imaginary number named 𝒊. 
				What makes 𝒊 imaginary? 
				And why is an imaginary number even useful?
				Recall that any number multiplied by itself will always be a positive number.
				For example, 7 × 7 = 49. But also -7 × -7 = 49.
				For brevity we could rewrite those equations as 7<sup>2</sup> = 49 and -7<sup>2</sup> = 49, respectively.
				No matter what <em>real number</em> you try,
				when you multiply it by itself the product will be a positive number.
				Try solving for 𝒙 in this equation: 𝒙² = 49. 
				You’ll find that 𝒙 can equal 7 <em>and</em> 𝒙 can also equal -7. 
				Both are true.
				But now try solving for 𝒙 in this equation: 𝒙² = -49.
				There is no real solution.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here comes 𝒊 to the rescue. 
				The imaginary number 𝒊 represents the impossible solution to the 
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root" target="_blank">square root</a> of <em>negative</em> one. We can express that elegantly in two ways:
			</p>
<pre><code>
𝒊² = −1

𝒊 = √-1

</code></pre>
			<p>
				This is what Monty Python’s John Cleese might call the
				impossible intermediate.
				And with it we can now <em>sort of</em> solve for 𝒙 in 𝒙² = -49:
			</p>
<pre><code>
𝒙² = -49

𝒙  = √-49

𝒙  = √(49 × -1)

𝒙  = √49 × √-1

𝒙  = 7 × √-1

𝒙  = 7 × 𝒊

𝒙  = 7𝒊

</code></pre>


			<p>
				Our result, 7𝒊, is an
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number" target="_blank">imaginary number</a>
				that consists of a real number multiplier, 7, and 
				our special imaginary number 𝒊.
				Imaginary numbers also exist along an infinite number line—with zero in the middle, negative numbers to the left, and positive to the right:
			</p>
<pre><code>
…  -3𝒊 -2𝒊  -1𝒊  0  +1𝒊 +2𝒊 +3𝒊  …  
┄───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┄  

</pre></code>
			<h3 id="Complex_numbers">Complex numbers: ℂ</h3>
			<p>
				We just saw that multiplying a real number (ℝ) by the imaginary number 𝒊
				yields a number that is also imaginary (𝕀).
				But what if you add a real number to an imaginary one?
				Things get <em>complex</em>.
				A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number" target="_blank">complex number</a>
				is a number that can be expressed in the form 
				𝒂 + 𝒃𝒊, where 𝒂 is the real component (ℝ) and 𝒃𝒊 is the imaginary 
				component (𝕀). 
				Some examples might be 1 + 2𝒊 or 3 - 4𝒊.
				This is what the <code>ComplexNumber</code> class was built to handle.
				Open up your JavaScript console and paste in the following:
			</p>
<pre><code>
var 
a = new Q.ComplexNumber( 1,  2 ),
b = new Q.ComplexNumber( 3, -4 )

</pre></code>
			<p>
				Now we have two variables, 𝒂 and 𝒃, that we can operate with. 
				As you might guess, <code>ComplexNumber</code>
				includes instance methods for common operations like 
				addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divion.
				It also includes a handy <code>toString</code> for expressing
				a complex number in our familiar way.
				For example <code>a.toString()</code> will output <samp>1 + 2i</samp>.
				Try the following lines individually in your JavaScript console:
			</p>
<pre><code>
'𝒂 = '+ a.toString()
'𝒃 = '+ b.toString()

'𝒂 + 𝒃 = '+ a.add( b ).toString()
'𝒂 - 𝒃 = '+ a.subtract( b ).toString()
'𝒂 × 𝒃 = '+ a.multiply( b ).toString()
'𝒂 ÷ 𝒃 = '+ a.divide( b ).toString()

</pre></code>
			<p>
				Operation functions on <code>Q.ComplexNumber</code> instances generally accept as 
				arguments both sibling instances and pure <code>Number</code> instances, though the 
				value returned is always an instance of <code>Q.ComplexNumber</code>.
			</p>
			<h3 id="Reduction">Reduction</h3>
			<p>
				We can check that 𝒊² = -1.
			</p>
<pre><code>
var i  = new Q.ComplexNumber( 0,  1 )

'𝒊  = '+ i.toString()
'𝒊² = '+ i.power( 2 ).toString()

</pre></code>
