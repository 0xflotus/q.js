			<h3>Introducing Q.js</h3>
			<p>
				Q is quantum computing in your browser.
				Or a <em>simulation</em> of it anyway—after all, you cannot do actual quantum physics on a classical computer!
				So why build this? 
				The same reason Google, IBM, and Microsoft build quantum simulators:
				to explore quantum circuit design in a cheap and easy medium before applying those designs to the real hardware.
				This project was started by me, <a href="http://stewartsmith.io" target="_blank">Stewart Smith</a>, 
				in April 2019
				as a learning and teaching tool for Web coders interested in quantum programming.
				(I’m learning as I go along!)
				Q’s code repository is avilable on GitHub at
				<a href="https://github.com/stewdio/q.js" target="_blank">https://github.com/stewdio/q.js</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the future, Q will take advantage of the browser
				as a graphic user interface, 
				but for now all of the action takes place 
				in your browser’s JavaScript console.
				You can use the following key commands to open it:

			<h3>Getting started</h3>
			<p>
				Once you have your JavaScript console open you can start playing.
				Want to launch a qubit in to superposition straight away? Have at it:
			</p>
			<pre><code>
Q.<a href="Gate.html">Gate</a>.HADAMARD.applyTo( Q.<a href="Qubit.html">Qubit</a>.HORIZONTAL )
			</pre></code>
			<br>
			<p>
				Or perform the most superfluous coin-flip code ever:  				
			</p>
			<pre><code>
Q.<a href="Gate.html">Gate</a>.HADAMARD.applyTo( Q.<a href="Qubit.html">Qubit</a>.HORIZONTAL ).collapse().targetBit
			</pre></code>
			<br>
			<h3>Roadmap</h3>
			<p>
				Q is very much a work-in-progress.
				Right now the basic non-imaginary math works for matrices, qubits, and gates.
				The <code><a href="ComplexNumber.html">ComplexNumber</a></code> class is now in place, so the next step is to 
				integrate that in to matrices and qubits. 
				Then would be a good time to update the documentation here and in the code itself
				so that all of the math examples, code examples, and the tone-of-voice are consistent.
				Then we can get more serious about logic gates, and building the graphic user interface!
			</p>
			<p>
				Are you in to this stuff? Quantum computing? JavaScript and the Web?
				I could use some help building this out!
				I have some strong opinions about code style and what counts as simple and/or elegant—so leave your semicolons behind!—but there’s a lot of heavy lifting to be done and I’m willing to listen :)
