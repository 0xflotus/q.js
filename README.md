Q.js
==============================================================================

Q.js is quantum computing in your browser. I’m just learning how quantum 
computation works—and I’m writing Q.js as I go along. This is starting small, 
but I think it’s got big potential. Right now all the action is in your 
JavaScript console, so open that up!

The examples you see in the console are coming from `index.html`. Open that up
to see how it all works. Or if you just want to launch a qubit in to 
superposition straight away then have at it:
`Q.Gate.HADAMARD.multiply( Q.Qubit.H )`
