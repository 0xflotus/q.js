Q is a quantum circuit editor and simulator that runs right in your
web browser. There’s nothing to install and nothing to configure—so
[jump right in and start experimenting!](https://quantumjavascript.app)
Q’s drag-and-drop circuit editor makes codeless composition easy. Or
pop open your browser’s JavaScript console to go deeper with Q’s
intuitive—and heavily documented—API. (Because Q’s visual editor and
the underlying circuit it represents are always listening to each
other, it’s easy to hop back and forth between code and interface.)
Q’s editor crunches live probability results and circuits are 
exportable as a variety of formats. 
  
Q is free to use, open-source, and includes simple explanations to get
you up to speed on the basics of quantum computing. This makes Q ideal
for the classroom as well as autodidacts at home. Q just might be the
most accessible quantum circuit suite in the world. Q’s source
code—including documentation—is available for download right here on
GitHub: https://github.com/stewdio/q.js
